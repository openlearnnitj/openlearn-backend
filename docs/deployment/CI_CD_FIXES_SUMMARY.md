# CI/CD Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. "Unrecognized named-value: 'secrets'" Error
**Problem**: The main workflow was trying to use secrets in the environment URL context, which is not supported by GitHub Actions.

**Solution**: Removed the `url` field from the environment configuration in `.github/workflows/main.yml`:
```yaml
# Before (BROKEN)
environment: 
  name: production
  url: http://${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}:3000

# After (FIXED)
environment: production
```

### 2. PR Title Validation Removed
**Problem**: The PR validation workflow contained unnecessary conventional commit format validation.

**Solution**: Removed the "Validate PR title" step from `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` while keeping useful checks like PR description validation.

### 3. Professional Formatting
**Problem**: Workflows and documentation contained emojis, making them look unprofessional.

**Solution**: Removed all emojis from:
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` 
- `.github/workflows/develop.yml`
- `docs/CI_CD_WORKFLOW.md`

### 4. EC2_USER Clarification
**Problem**: Unclear what value should be used for the EC2_USER secret.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive documentation explaining that EC2_USER should be the SSH username for your EC2 instance:
- `ubuntu` for Ubuntu AMI
- `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux AMI
- `admin` for Debian AMI
- `centos` for CentOS AMI

## New Documentation

### 1. GitHub Secrets Setup Guide
Created `docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` with:
- Detailed explanation of all required secrets
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Common issues and troubleshooting
- Security best practices
- Manual testing procedures

### 2. Updated CI/CD Documentation
Enhanced `docs/CI_CD_WORKFLOW.md` with:
- Professional formatting (no emojis)
- Reference to the new secrets setup guide
- Clearer workflow descriptions
- Better troubleshooting section

## Workflow Structure

### Main Pipeline (`main.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs to main
- **Jobs**: Test → Deploy (main only) → Notify
- **Features**: Professional logging, health checks, rollback on failure

### PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)  
- **Triggers**: PRs to main
- **Jobs**: Check draft → PR validation → Tests → Security → Comment
- **Features**: Skip validation for drafts, auto-comment with results

### Develop Pipeline (`develop.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to develop
- **Jobs**: Test → Notify
- **Features**: Ensures develop branch stability

## Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `EC2_PRIVATE_KEY` | SSH private key content | `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...` |
| `EC2_HOST` | Server IP or domain | `54.123.456.789` |
| `EC2_USER` | SSH username | `ubuntu` |

## Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub secrets** using the guide in `docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`
2. **Test the workflows** by pushing to develop branch first
3. **Verify deployment** by merging a small change to main
4. **Monitor logs** in GitHub Actions for any remaining issues

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test locally before pushing
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint

# Test deployment script locally
./scripts/test-local.sh

# Troubleshoot server issues
./scripts/troubleshoot.sh

# Set up CI/CD from scratch
./scripts/setup-cicd.sh
```
