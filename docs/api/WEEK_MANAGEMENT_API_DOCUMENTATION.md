  -d '{"email": "admin@openlearn.com", "password": "SecurePass123!"}' \
  | jq -r '.data.accessToken')

# 2. Create first week
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/weeks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning",
    "description": "Foundations of ML, basic concepts, and getting started",
    "order": 1,
    "leagueId": "your_league_id"
  }'

# 3. Create second week

    "name": "Week 2: Data Preprocessing",
    "description": "Learning to clean and prepare data for ML algorithms",
    "order": 2,
    "leagueId": "your_league_id"
  }'

# 4. Get all weeks for league
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/weeks/league/your_league_id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 5. Update a week
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3000/api/weeks/week_id" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Week 1: ML Fundamentals & Python Setup",
    "description": "Updated description with more details"
  }'
```

### Test Validation
```bash
# Test duplicate order (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/weeks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Duplicate Week",
    "description": "This should fail",
    "order": 1,
    "leagueId": "your_league_id"
  }'
# Expected: {"success":false,"error":"Week with order 1 already exists in this league"}

# Test invalid order (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/weeks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Invalid Week",

}
```

**404 Not Found:**

## Business Rules

1. **Week Ordering**: Each week must have a unique order within its league
2. **Sequential Ordering**: Recommended to use sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...)
3. **Deletion Protection**: Cannot delete weeks that have sections
4. **League Relationship**: Weeks belong to exactly one league
5. **Role Restrictions**: Only Chief Pathfinder+ can manage weeks
6. **Audit Logging**: All week operations are logged for tracking

---

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

With Week Management complete, the next logical step is implementing **Section Management**:

1. **Sections**: Individual learning units within weeks
2. **Resources**: Learning materials (blogs, videos, links) within sections
3. **Progress Tracking**: Track section completion for students

This will complete the content structure: `Cohort â†’ Specialization â†’ League â†’ Week â†’ Section â†’ Resources`
