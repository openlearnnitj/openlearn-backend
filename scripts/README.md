## Usage Guidelines

### Running Scripts
Most scripts should be run from the project root directory:
```bash
# From project root
./scripts/testing/test-authentication.sh
./scripts/deployment/deploy-production.sh
```

### Environment Requirements
- Ensure proper environment variables are set
- Database connection should be configured
- Required dependencies should be installed
- Proper permissions for script execution

### Best Practices
1. **Test Before Production**: Always test scripts in development first
2. **Backup Data**: Create backups before running maintenance scripts
3. **Monitor Execution**: Watch script output for errors or warnings
4. **Document Changes**: Update documentation when modifying scripts
5. **Version Control**: Keep scripts under version control

### Script Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names with hyphens for separation
- Include script purpose in filename
- Add `.sh` extension for shell scripts
- Group related scripts in appropriate directories

## Contributing

When adding new scripts:
1. Place in appropriate category directory
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Include proper error handling
4. Add usage comments at script top
5. Update this README if adding new categories
6. Test thoroughly before committing

## Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data**: Never hardcode credentials in scripts
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration
- **Permissions**: Set appropriate file permissions (usually 755 for executable scripts)
- **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to production scripts
